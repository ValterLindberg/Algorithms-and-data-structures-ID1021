ID1021 - Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains assignments and projects from the Algorithms and Data Structures course (ID1021) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 
The course covers fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, emphasizing efficient data manipulation and retrieval techniques. 
The projects demonstrate proficiency in analyzing algorithmic complexity and implementing classic data structures in a scalable manner.

Key Topics Covered:

Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort)
Searching algorithms and data indexing
Basic and advanced data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables)
Algorithm complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
